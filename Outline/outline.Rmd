## 1. Overview
Each week I will read through Chapters of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund and Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz and complete the exercises provided in the chapters. If time permits, I'll find an external data set and implement the methods I've learned.

2. Tibbles with tibble (Chapter 7 r4ds) \& Probabilistic Learning - Classification Using Naive Bayes (Chapter 4 MLwR)
3. Data import with readr (Chapter 8 r4ds) \& Divide and Conquer - Classification Using Decision Trees and Rules (Chapter 5 MLwR)
4. Tidy Data with tidyr (Chapter 9 r4ds) \& Understanding regression trees and model trees (pps. 200-216) (Chapter 6 MLwR)
5. Relational Data with dplyr (Chapter 10 r4ds) \& Black Box Methods - Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines (Chapter 7 MLwR)
6. Strings with stringr (Chapter 11 r4ds) \& Finding Patterns - Market Basket Analysis Using Association Rules (Chapter 8 MLwR)
7. factors with forcats (Chapter 12 r4ds) \& Evaluating Model Performance (Chapter 10 MLwR)
